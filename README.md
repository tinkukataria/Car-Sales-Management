# Car-Sales-Management
##Introduction

It is a Data File Handling project. It is written in C++. The Car Sales Management System tracks entries and gives the users some management functionalities using data file handling in C++.

##Working

The program starts off with a welcome screen, followed by a prompt for the user to make entries into the data file system. After the user makes initial enteries (As many as they want), they are given a menu of operations. The program then becomes a menu-driven program which performs file management operations as long as the user decides to quit. The system basically uses an identification key (VIN Number, which is unique for each vehicle) to track the entries in the files and make changes in them, if needed.

##Functionalities

The user is allowed to use the following operations:

Append : This function allows the addition of new entries to the .DAT file, storing all the car data.

Modify : This allows the user to search and modify a specific entry.

Search : This allows the user to search for an entry and look at its details.

Delete : This allows the user to delete a specific entry.

Display : This allows the user to see all the entries made until that point in time.

Exit : This allows the user to exit the program. A Thank You slide is shown. Alternatively, the user can deny to continue when prompted, in order to exit the program.
